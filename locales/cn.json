	"The main advantage of foreign exchange (Forex) is that is open around the clock 24 hours a day 5 days a week, enabling traders to buy and sell from Sunday night to Friday night and access leverage in order to speculate from global currency flows and news events. Forex is also the largest and most liquid market in the world making it the last of the true arenas where fair market competition and real price discovery exists": "外汇的主要优势是每周5天24小时开放，这就使交易者能使用杠杆从周日晚上到周五晚上都可以进行买卖，以便从全球货币流动和新闻事件中进行投机。外汇市场也是世界上最大和最具流动性的市场，使它成为能够公平参与市场竞争和真实价格提现的一个真正的平台。",

	"The Forex market is open 24 hours a day, 5 days a week. Trading starts when major global financial centres around the world open. The market opens in New Zealand on Sunday evening and ends after the market closes in New York on Friday. The greatest liquidity occurs when multiple time zones overlap": "外汇市场每天开放24小时，每周5天。当全球主要金融中心对外开放时，交易就开始了。新西兰股市星期日晚间开盘，星期五在纽约股市收盘后结束。当不同时区的股市同时可以交易的时段，流动性是最好的。",
	"Liquidity": "流动性",
	"One of the main benefits of the Forex market is its superior liquidity. The foreign exchange market is the most liquid market in the world, this is one of the main differentiating factors between the Forex market and other financial markets. The foreign exchange market turns over 5 trillion dollars each day and this high liquidity means that your assets can be quickly converted to cash without any price discount, making it easy to convert a large sum of money into a foreign currency with little impact on the price": "外汇市场的主要优势之一是其极强的流动性。外汇市场是世界上最具流动性的市场，这也是外汇市场与其他金融市场的主要区别因素之一。外汇市场每天的交易量超过5万亿美元，这种高流动性意味着您的资产可以在没有任何价格折扣的情况下快速地转换成现金，从而很容易地将大量的钱转换成一种外币，而对价格影响很小。",

	"Leverage": "杠杆",
	"Forex can be traded on leverage. Leverage means a lower initial outlay is required to open a larger position. For example, if you have $1,000 in your trading account and use leverage of 1:100, you would be able to open a position with a value of $100,000 (100 times the amount in the your account). It is however important to note that although leverage gives traders the ability to open larger positions to maximise potential profits, the potential for loss is equally as large": "外汇交易 可以使用杠杆交易。杠杆意味着仅需要较少的资金即可撬动更大的头寸。例如，如果您的交易账户里有1000美元，使用1:100的杠杆率，您就可以开立价值为100，000美元的头寸（是您账户金额的100倍）。然而，值得注意的是，尽管杠杆使交易者能够开出更大的头寸来最大化潜在的利润，但损失的可能性同样大。",
	"Trade Both Rising and Falling Markets": "在上涨和下跌市场中交易",
	"There are no restrictions in the Forex market as to which direction you can trade. This means that if you believe a currency pair is going to increase in value you can buy it or ‘go long’. Similarly, if you believe the pair is going to decrease in value you could sell it, or ‘go short’": "外汇市场没有限制，您可以多空两个方向做交易。这意味着，如果您认为一个货币对价值会增加，您就可以将其买入或“做多”。同样，如果您相信这对价值会下降，您就可以将其卖出，或者“卖空”。",
	"Low Cost of Trading": "低交易成本",
	"The cost per transaction in Forex is less than a tenth of the cost of your average stock trade. This represents a huge saving. It also means a lower investment amount is needed to begin trading Forex": "外汇交易中的每笔交易成本不到平均股票交易成本的十分之一。这就节约了大量的成本。这也意味着只需较低的资金就可以开始外汇交易。",
	"Transparency": "公开透明",
	"In some exchange based markets, larger players have been known to move stocks or commodities in order to gain an unfair advantage. Given the deep liquidity in the foreign exchange market it is almost impossible to interfere with general market forces. This results in a fair and transparent market for all participants": "在一些场内交易市场中，已知较大的参与者为了获得不公平的优势而操纵股票或大宗商品。鉴于外汇市场的流动性很强，一般的场内势力几乎不可能干预，这就为所有参与者提供一个公平透明的市场",
	"Volatility": "市场波动性",
	"Due to the huge daily volumes of the Forex market there is always volatility. Increased volatility means more access to trading opportunities. You have the ability to pick currency pairs that suit your trading style. For example the AUD/NZD is a great currency to begin trading as a beginner due to its lower daily range and low spread, whereas the EUR/USD would be better suited for an advanced trader due to its large daily range and the speed with which it moves": "由于外汇市场巨大的日成交量，波动也是一直存在的。波动性的加剧意味着更多的交易机会。您有能力选择适合您的交易风格的货币对。例如，澳元/纽元由于其较窄的日间波动幅度和较低的点差，是初学者开始交易的一种很合适的货币对，而欧元/美元由于其较大的日间波动和其涨跌的速度，更适合高级交易者。",

Further information regarding the benefits and risks can be found in our Product Disclosure Statement": "在使用杠杆交易产品之前，您应该首先考虑您的风险偏好和投资策略。使用杠杆有利有弊，既能扩大利润，也会加剧亏损。如果市场出现不利于您的巨幅波动，您的账户可能会出现穿仓。这里需要强调的是您并不实际拥有差价合约下的标的产品。可以在我们网站找到关于CFD交易的收益和风险的详解。 产品揭示书",

	"CFD stands for ‘Contract for Difference’ and is a contract between two parties agreeing to exchange the difference in the value of a security, instrument, or other asset between the time at which the CFD is opened and the time at which it is closed": "CFD代表“差价合约”，是双方当事人之间的合同，双方当事人同意在差价合约开立时和关闭时交换证券、票据或其他资产价值的差额。",
	"CFDs are extremely versatile products growing in popularity as a short term investment tool. They provide an efficient way of maximizing your capital outlay and can help diversify your existing investment portfolio or hedge a position. Some of the advantages of trading CFDs are listed below": "CFDS是一种极为流行的产品，越来越受欢迎，成为一种短期投资产品。它们提供了一种有效的方法来最大化您的资本，并且可以帮助分散您现有的投资组合或套期保值。交易CFD的一些优点如下.",
	"Speculate in Both Rising and Falling Markets": "在上涨和下跌市场中投机",
	"CFDs are derivatives based on an underlying instrument. There is no ownership of the underlying asset, however they allow you to participate in the price movement of the asset. This means you can potentially profit in both rising and falling markets": "CFDS是基于标的产品的衍生产品。虽然您没有标的资产所有权，但您可以在资产的价格变动中交易。这意味着您既可以在上涨的市场也可以在下跌的市场上获利。",
	"In a rising market you would look to buy a CFD and then sell at a later date. This is called ‘going long’": "在一个不断上涨的市场，您想买入CFD，然后再出售。这叫做“做多”。",
	"In a falling market you would look to sell a CFD position first and then buy it back at a later date closing out the position. This is known as ‘going short’": "在下跌的市场中，您会先卖出一个CFD的头寸，然后在稍后的时间购回该产品从而关闭仓位。这就是所谓的“做空”。",
	"Efficient Use of Capital": "资本的有效利用",
	"CFDs are leveraged products enabling traders to increase their exposure to an underlying asset with a small initial outlay. When you open a trade you only need to deposit a small percentage of the value of the position and this is known as margin. Your margin will vary depending on the value of your CFD position. Leverage can result in added gains should the market move in your favour, however it also carries risks and can result in increased looses should your position move against you": "CFDS是杠杆产品，使交易者能够用少量的资金参与到标的资产的交易中去。当您开仓交易，您只需要在仓位里存入一小部分资金，这就是所谓的保证金。您开仓所需保证金会根据您标的CFD价值的变化而变化。如果市场向对您有利的方向发展，杠杆可以带来额外的收益，但如果市场走势与您开仓方向相反，也会带来风险，杠杆可以导致更多的损失。",
	"Hedging Other Investments": "对冲其它投资",
	"The ability ‘go long’ as well as ‘go short’ with CFDs means that they are a great tool for hedging an existing portfolio. They are a cost effective alternative to selling the portfolio prematurely and can be used to provide ‘insurance’ against adverse price movements": "CFD的“做多”和“做空”的特性就意味着它们是对冲现有投资组合的一个很好的产品。这也是一种性价比很高的方式去提前了结现有的投资组合，同时也可以为价格反向运动提供”对冲“。",
	"For example, if you have a long-term portfolio that you wish to keep, however you are of the view that there is some short term risk to the value of the portfolio you could use CFDs to ‘hedge’ your positions. If the value of the portfolio falls the profit you make on the CFDs will offset the losses in your portfolio": "例如，如果您希望持有一个长期投资组合，但您认为，现有投资组合存在一些短期的风险，您可以使用CFD来'对冲'您的头寸。如果投资组合的资产价值下降，您在CFD上的利润将抵消您的投资组合中的损失。",
	"Flexible Contract Sizes": "灵活的合同大小",
	"The contract sizes of CFDs are often less than the typical contract size of the underlying instrument which means you can gain exposure to the price movement of the instrument without a significant deposit. Flexible sizing allows you to tailor your trading according to your risk management criteria": "CFD的合同大小通常小于标的的投资产品的合同大小，这意味着您可以在不需要巨额保证金的情况下参与到标的投资产品的价格变动中去。灵活的合同大小能够在满足您风险管理标准的情况下设计出符合您的交易需求。",
	"Access Global Financial Markets": "参与全球金融市场",
	"CFDs allow traders access to a wide range of global markets that would otherwise be difficult to access. CFDs make it easy to trade commodities like Gold, Silver, Oil, as well as a variety of global indices without having to trade the futures contract itself": "CFDS使交易者能够参与到原本很难进行投资的全球市场。CFD使得交易黄金、白银、石油等商品以及全球指数变得更加便利，而不必交易期货合约本身。",
	"You should always consider your risk appetite and investment strategy prior to trading leveraged products. Leverage can work for you as well as against you and can magnify profits as well as losses. In the event of a significant move against you, you may lose more than your initial deposit. It is also important to be aware that you do not own the underlying instrument over which the CFD is based. Further information regarding the benefits and risks of CFD trading can be found in our Product Disclosure Statement": "在使用杠杆交易产品之前，您应该首先考虑您的风险偏好和投资策略。使用杠杆有利有弊，既能扩大利润，也会加剧亏损。如果市场出现不利于您的巨幅波动，你的账户可能会出现穿仓。这里需要强调的是您并不实际拥有差价合约下的标的产品。可以在我们网站找到关于CFD交易的收益和风险的详解。 产品揭示书",
